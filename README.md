# ModelsAtHome: Linear Regression

This project is part of the *ModelsAtHome* series, where I learn and reimplement machine learning models from scratch.  
This notebook and code demonstrate a custom implementation of **Linear Regression**, with support for:

- Ordinary Least Squares
- Ridge Regression (L2)
- Lasso Regression (L1)

## File Structure

- `linear_regression/`: Core implementation
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook to test and explore
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## How to Use

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
